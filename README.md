The repository provides a method for expanding medical text datasets using synthetic data generated by OpenAI's language models. This process aids in creating robust models by offering varied data, which is crucial in medical text analysis.

### Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **RuMedBench Repository**: clone the repository to your local machine using the command `git clone https://github.com/pavel-blinov/RuMedBench.git`.
- **Anaconda Environment**: set up the necessary environment by running `conda env create -f environment.yml`.

### Generating and Utilizing Synthetic Data

1. **Synthetic Data Generation**: use the notebook `synthetic_symptoms_generation.ipynb` for creating new synthetic data. If you prefer not to generate data, utilize the pre-generated datasets available at `results/gpt_3.5_turbo_RuMedTop3.jsonl` and `results/gpt_4_RuMedTop3.jsonl`.
   
2. **Data Integration**: integrate the synthetic data with the original dataset found at `RuMedBench/data/RuMedTop3/train_v1.jsonl` to enrich your dataset.
   
3. **Model Training**: follow the detailed [training instructions](https://github.com/pavel-blinov/RuMedBench/tree/main/code#general-description) provided in the RuMedBench repository to train your models using the augmented dataset.

4. **Evaluation**: after training, evaluate your models' performance by following the [evaluation instructions](https://github.com/pavel-blinov/RuMedBench/tree/main/code#evalpy) from RuMedBench.

By following these steps, you can successfully augment your medical text data with synthetic data and potentially improve your models' performance.
